My Journey with Google Apps Script & CRUD:
In 2020, during the global COVID-19 pandemic, I was first introduced to the concept of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. While in lockdown, I decided to take this time to learn how to develop this fundamental feature. However, the journey wasn’t easy, and I encountered numerous challenges along the way.

That’s when I discovered an incredible YouTube channel called 'Learn Google Sheets & Excel Spreadsheets' Channel link: https://www.youtube.com/@ExcelGoogleSheets. This channel was a turning point for me. Despite the creator never revealing his identity or face, the content was invaluable. The lessons taught me more than I could have imagined, and if these courses had a price tag, they would have easily been worth over $20,000-$50,000.

I learned how to implement CRUD functionality using Google Spreadsheets as the database—an entirely free solution. It took me over six months to grasp the basics of JavaScript and Google Apps Script, but it was well worth the effort. This experience led JavaScript/Google Apps Script to become my favorite programming language.

Since then, I’ve continued experimenting and solving different problems using this system. Understanding CRUD has been like uncovering the building blocks of many other advanced functions.

While I don’t consider myself a professional programmer, and my code may not be perfect, I’m proud of the progress I’ve made. I’m still learning and improving every day.

Thank you for checking out my project! If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, feel free to reach out. I’m always open to learning more.
